#LogCounter

Concept used: Counters in Hadoop

Problem Definition:
Given an input file that contains logs
The target is to count the number of different types of logs
The log contains 3 types of Logs:
- INFO
- ERROR
- WARNING

Sample Input file:
INFO: Info Debug 1
WARNING: Warning Debug 1
INFO: Info Debug 2
ERROR: Error Debug 1
WARNING: Warning Debug 2
ERROR: Error Debug 2
INFO: Info Debug 3

Output for sample input:
INFO: 3
WARNING: 2
ERROR: 2


Important Lesson:
Value of Counter in Mapper is not accessible in the Reducer. The reason for that might be that at a time many Reducers may be simultaneously be working on the counter. So getting the correct value will require a synchronization mechanism in the HDFS Framework and well as the application. This mechanism seems neither practical nor implementable.

But associative operations can surly be performed on Counter be it in Mapper or Reducer. Hence increment(value) is supported. In such a case same global copy of the Counter gets edited.

On the other hand, the values are available in Driver Class. The reason is that at that point on Driver class has the access to the Counter.

Also, if similar mechnaism is to be implemented, the counter values can always be written through context.
